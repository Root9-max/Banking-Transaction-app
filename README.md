# Banking Transaction App

## Overview
A console-based banking application built in Java to simulate core banking
operations. The project was developed to reinforce object-oriented programming
principles, application flow control, and basic authentication logic.

## Features
- Account creation
- User authentication (login)
- View account balance
- Deposit funds
- Withdraw funds with validation
- Transaction history tracking

## Tech Stack
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## Project Structure
com.bankapp
├── Main.java
├── model
│   ├── Account.java
│   └── Transaction.java
└── service

## How It Works
1. User creates an account with a username and password
2. User logs in using credentials
3. Authenticated users can perform banking operations
4. Each transaction is recorded and displayed on request

## What I Learned
- Designing a simple system using OOP principles
- Managing application state and user flow
- Implementing basic authentication logic
- Tracking and displaying transaction history
- Structuring Java packages correctly

## Future Improvements
- Password hashing
- Database persistence (SQL)
- REST API layer
- GUI or web interface
